## Deployment Instructions

When asked to "push", "deploy", "push live", or "push to Vercel":

1. Check git status for changes
2. Stage relevant files with `git add`
3. Commit with descriptive message using HEREDOC format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Commit title here
   
   - Bullet point details
   EOF
   )"
   ```
4. Push to origin master: `git push origin master`
5. Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub

## Things That Didn't Work / Lessons Learned

> **IMPORTANT:** Document ALL failed approaches here with reasons. This prevents going in circles.

### Chart Libraries
- **Chart.js**: Initially used but replaced with ApexCharts for better customization, zoom/pan, and multiple y-axes support
- **Plotly**: Initial version (dark theme) - replaced with ApexCharts for lighter weight and better UX

### Revenue Display
- **Revenue as line chart**: Didn't convey monthly totals well. Switched to stepped area bars (day 1-25 with gap at day 26-27) which clearly shows monthly blocks
- **Hiding $0 revenue months**: Created gaps in chart. Must include $0 months to maintain continuity
- **Hiding $0 in tooltip**: Confusing when revenue bar shows but tooltip doesn't mention it. Show "Revenue: $0" explicitly

### Data Handling
- **Hardcoded domain lists only**: Limited flexibility. Now dynamically load all domains from CSV and filter by revenue > $0.01

### Layout
- **Date selector centered above chart**: User preferred it in original position (right side of chart header). Reverted.

### Annotations
- **ApexCharts point annotations for revenue labels**: Works well but needs toggle since it can clutter the chart

### Tooltip
- **Smooth day-by-day tooltip following cursor X position**: Added then reverted. Caused issues - tooltip needs to snap to actual data points, not interpolate between them

### DR (Domain Rating) Display - Multiple Iterations
- **DR as 4th series on main chart (first attempt)**: Added but cluttered the chart
- **DR in separate stat card with sparkline**: Moved DR off chart into its own card. Removed later - redundant since DR visible on chart
- **Custom legend for DR**: Tried custom legend component. Removed - ApexCharts built-in clickable legend works better
- **WINNER: DR as purple dotted line on chart**: Dotted style distinguishes it from traffic lines, separate right y-axis (0-100 scale)

### Toggle Implementation
- **Toggle in chart legend area**: Tried moving revenue label toggle into legend. Harder to find
- **WINNER: Slider toggle in header**: More visible, clear on/off state

### Chart Styling
- **Area fill on traffic lines (Our Data, Ahrefs)**: Made chart look heavy/cluttered. Removed fills, kept as clean lines. Only Revenue keeps subtle 25% opacity fill

### Traffic-Revenue Correlation Methods (from earlier analysis)
- **Same-Month Latest (last snapshot only)**: Correlation 0.48 - noisy, doesn't smooth out daily fluctuations
- **30-Day Lagged traffic**: Correlation 0.50 - not as good as same-month
- **60-Day Lagged traffic**: Correlation 0.47 - worse than other methods
- **WINNER: Same-Month Average**: Correlation 0.58 - averaging all snapshots within the month smooths noise and gives best correlation

### Stability Calculation (from earlier analysis)
- **CV from all raw traffic snapshots**: Measures snapshot-to-snapshot noise, not meaningful month-to-month stability
- **WINNER: CV from same-month averages**: Aligns with how revenue is recorded (monthly), captures actual month-over-month volatility

### Traffic Band Analysis (from earlier analysis)
- **Site-level bands (overall average per site)**: Doesn't show direct traffic→revenue relationship
- **WINNER: Month-level bands (each site-month is separate)**: Shows "when a site has X traffic in a given month, how much revenue does it typically make?"

## Update Instructions

**CRITICAL: When making ANY changes to this project, update this file:**

1. Add new features to "Current Features" section with [x] checkbox
2. Document EVERY failed approach in "Things That Didn't Work" with:
   - What was tried
   - Why it didn't work
   - What solution was used instead
3. Keep file structure current
4. Add new data sources if added

---

## Common Tasks

### Add a new data series to chart
1. Load data in `loadDataFromCSV()` or create new loader function
2. Add to domain object in the merge loop
3. Add series config in `createChart()` options
4. Add y-axis config if needed
5. Update tooltip custom function
6. Update legend colors array

### Change time periods for rankings
- Modify `currentMonth` and `last3Months` variables in `calculateRevenueRankings()`
- Same in leaderboard.html `loadRevenueCSV()`

### Local development
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/index-apex.html
```
Note: Opening HTML directly via `file://` won't load CSVs (browser security). Use local server.
Note: Auth only works in production (Vercel). Local dev bypasses auth.

### Manage allowed users
Update `ALLOWED_EMAILS` env var in Vercel dashboard (comma-separated list).
No redeploy needed - changes take effect immediately.

### Required Vercel Environment Variables
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | From Google Cloud Console OAuth credentials |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | From Google Cloud Console OAuth credentials |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Random 32+ char string for signing cookies |
| `ALLOWED_EMAILS` | Comma-separated list of approved emails |
